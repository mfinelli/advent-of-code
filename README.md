# Advent of Code

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

## usage

```shell
cargo run -- yXXdYY ./path/to/input
```

Where `yXXdYY` corresponds to a year and (zero-padded) day e.g., `y22d01`.

You can also provide the input on `stdin`:

```shell
cargo run -- yXXdYY - < ./path/to/input
```
